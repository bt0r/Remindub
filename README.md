# Remindub

Remindub is a github's pull-request reminder for discord.
It allows you to receive notification on discord when someone is waiting for your review on a pull-request.

As pull-reminder (ex' pull-panda) have been bought by Github and only allows to receive notifications threw Slack, Remindub comes as an alternative.
